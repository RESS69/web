            <p class="slides-text">The Astral Express is a large train that serves as one of the main settings of Honkai: Star Rail. It was created by the Aeon Akivili the Trailblaze, and used to transport them and the Nameless across the galaxy. After Akivili's disappearance, it fell into disrepair and eventually crash-landed onto an unnamed planet. Himeko discovered the wreckage and repaired the Express, becoming its navigator and forming a new group of Nameless. The Astral Express Crew's goal is to retrace Akivili's steps, repairing the star rail they laid down thousands of years ago and sealing the Stellarons threatening the galaxy.</p>
