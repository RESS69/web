            <p class="slides-text">The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which mankind is almost extinct. Earth has been conquered by a robotic army—the Corrupted—twisted and warped by a biomechanical virus known as the Punishing Virus. The last survivors have fled into orbit, aboard the space station Babylonia. As commandant of the Gray Raven unit, you are tasked with assembling the greatest cyborg soldiers the world has known in order to push back the Corrupted, reclaim the Earth, and unravel the truths behind the Punishing Virus.</p>

            <p class="slides-text">Is the latest result of bionics and also one of the ways the humans can hope to fight against the Punishing Virus. They are built using special materials to reconstruct their human body and fully reproducing a human mind base through the Ego Ocean system, with this unique constitution, it can reduce the Punishing Virus intrusion on their consciousness, enabling them to fight against the Corrupted, despite being exposed to the Punishing Virus. However, when Construct technology was not yet mature, there was an unknown cruel period. </p>

            <p class="slides-text">The name given to the different beings/things infected with the Punishing Virus, these can range from electronic equipments to Mechanoids to Constructs etc...., each of these when infected can display varying and distinct forms of mutations, growth and destructive behaviors, however despite the sheer diversity of the forms the Virus can take on. Ultimately, their objective is the same; the efficient elimination of all human consciousness. Their Appetite and capacity for destruction is directly proportional to their own Punishing Virus Load, Which can Increase based on different circumstances.</p>

Babylonia was the first warp speed interstellar spacecraft of its class. considered as the pinnacle of human achievement, the Babylonia Project ushered in the Golden Age of "Unity and Prosperity" on Earth. The Punishing Virus then abruptly halted its further construction, however, and saw an influx of survivors, Evacuees hoping for a new life among the stars ,above Earth. Currently docked on an orbital space station, semi permanently, it now forms a launching pad for humans and Constructs planning to retake the Earth from the Virus and serves as a key communications hub, keeping in contact with surface reconnaissance.</p>
