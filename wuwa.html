            <p class="slides-text">Resonators are obtainable characters in Wuthering Waves. Individuals with the ability to resonate with certain objects and manipulate their frequencies are known as Resonators. </p>
            <p class="slides-text">Each Resonator has a Forte Examination Report that evaluates their status as a Resonator. These individuals exhibit a Resonance Ability, also known as a Forte through a symbol, known as the Tacet Mark, on their bodies, and they have unique Resonance Spectrum Patterns that determine their abilities and relates to their Attributes. They are classified by their Rabelle's Curve into one of the following: Natural, Mutant, Congenital, or Artificial. According to experts, a Resonator's abilities are often influenced by their past experiences and subconscious mind. </p>
