            <p class="slides-text">Fitting of its name as the Academy City, a majority of the inhabitants of Kivotos are students. They live alongside human-like animals and robots who are treated similarly to humans. Kivotos is mostly run by its students, including the General Student Council which oversees all of Kivotos. Likewise, most schools are self-managed by the students of that specific school, typically in the form of their student councils. </p>

            <p class="slides-text">Kivotos was made from the union of thousands of academies. The academies are divided into mostly independent districts. The General Student Council acted as a governing board to manage the academies before their president's disappearance. After that, the city became an anarchist society.</p>
